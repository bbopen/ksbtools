The class library and the test driver to check it out.  Kinda primative
as of today.

To test this part:

1) start the rcls and rcds services

2) run these ltester commands (all should return 0):

	./ltester -l test -c sso -C localhost

	./ltester -l test -p untamo -L localhost

	./ltester -l test -p no-my-pass -L localhost

	./ltester -l test -p untamo -U localhost

	./ltester -o rr -I localhost

	./ltester -S localhost

3) wait for the DNS timeout in sso.m (5 minutes unless you changed it)

4) run the above with "test" change to "test2" to be sure we refreshed
   the DNS RR

5) change the DNS RR and wait for the timeouts (ours + DNS's), see if the
   rcds list changed. (./ltester -o rr -I localhost) and run s/test/test3/.
