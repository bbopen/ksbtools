The class library and the test driver to check it out.  Kinda primative
as of today.

We force-load (preload in the manual page) the btree module when rcds
starts up.  The gtree module can be symbolic linked to as many tree
names as you like (pref, addr, hist, and the like).  It attaches to the
btree module for each new tree.  (That way we share a Berk DB environment
between all the btree modules).

The flat-file and ndbm modules don't have to have this complex system.


To test this:
	install rcds (../../libexec/rcds) and start it up

	Then from the host that is running rcds:
	(These should all return 0, and some useful looking data)

		./utester -N localhost

		./utester -E localhost

		./utester -u btree -M localhost 

		./utester -u btree -S test=thing -P localhost 

		./utester -u btree -S test -G localhost 

		./utester -u btree -S test2 -P localhost 

		./utester -u btree -S test2 -G localhost 

		./utester -u btree -Q localhost

		./utester -u btree -o te -R localhost

		./utester -u btree -o te= -R localhost

	These are not module specific (and should return 0): 

		./utester -I localhost 

		./utester  -o mods -q localhost

		./utester  -o units -q localhost

	There should return a failure
		./utester -U WwXxYyZz0o -E localhost
			(doesn't exist 1)

		./utester -N localhost
			(already exists 2)

		./utester -o unknown -q localhost
			(unknown command -1)

		./utester -u unknown -M localhost
			(unknown subcommand -2)

		./utester -u btree -S unknown -G localhost 
			(missing data -30994)

More advanced usage: build a subtree for prefs:tiger
		./utester -u prefs:tiger -M localhost 
		./utester -u prefs:kitty -M localhost 
		./utester -u prefs:lion -M localhost 

		./utester -u prefs: -o "" -R localhost 

		./utester -u prefs:lion -S color=yellow -P localhost 
		./utester -u prefs:tiger -S color=orange -P localhost 
		./utester -u prefs:kitty -S color=tabby -P localhost 

		./utester -u prefs:tiger -S color -G localhost
