This is the hash daemon that WebSSO uses to get a unique index for
each new Customer that builds credentials on www.fedex.com.  The
strings returned are friendly to most systems, except for the "/",
which I think we might replace with a "@".

Since nobody runs matride anymore (heheha) we steal the garcon
port to run our service.  That's funny.  For example:
 garcon stream tcp nowait ZZZ /usr/local/libexec/hashd hashd /var/sso/sequence
