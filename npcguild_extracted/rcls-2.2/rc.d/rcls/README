This is the startup for the WISE (Web Infrastructure Service Engine)
Btree login/data system.  We run the two different services based on the
existance of their data directories.  Make those with "rcls make-rcls"
(for the login service) and "rcls make-rcds" to just make the data
service.

The hash sequence _used_ to be accessed via hashd, but we folded the code
into the sso.m module for speed.  It must be owned as stater:data, mode 664
to be compatible with both access/update methods.
