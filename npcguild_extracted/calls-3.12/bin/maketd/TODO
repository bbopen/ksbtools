+ Did mkdep, test it?

	mkdep -ap -m makefile -f incfile ..

  maketd should now believe that incfile is included to find the local
  depends for the given files.  Scan the -m Makefile for variable
  defines.  Update the incfile rather than the Makefile.

+ When "gcc -M" fails to find an included file it outputs nothing on
  stdout which causes maketd to abort.  We might want to do the other
  files (under -d or -r at least)?
