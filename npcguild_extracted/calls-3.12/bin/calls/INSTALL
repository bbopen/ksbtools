Prep

 Find out how to get the C compile on your system to output the source
 code *after* macro expansion.  Some I have seen:
	/lib/cpp file.c
	/bin/cc -E file.c
	/usr/local/bin/gcc -E file.c


Compile

 Edit the Makefile to change where you want the calls program installed
 (change BIN).

 Edit main.c (I know, this should be in machine.h or some such, maybe later)
 and change the line:
	acCppCmd[1024] = "/lib/cpp ";

 to be the beginning of the way you found to make the C compiler output the
 source text after macro expansion (the text in quotes).

 Try making the calls binary:
	$ make

 Does it run at all:
	$ ./calls -V

 should output a version string (send this when you report a bug):
	calls: $Id: INSTALL,v 3.3 1997/04/14 02:46:02 ksb Exp $

 Test it:
	$ make graph | more

Install

 Just use
	# make install

 If you have mkcat use
	# mkcat calls.1u

 or rename is to calls.1 if your man program is stupid.  Else follow local
 custom for man pages.
