What does it do?

 Calls outputs a call graph of the functions in a C program.  This helps
 the maintainer of a large program decide how expensive it might be to
 change the interface to a function (for example).  With a little wrapper
 it can produce those (bogus) comment header block; or output just one
 function from a large source file (saves paper when printing).


What platforms?

 It runs under 4.2/4.3bsd, IBM's AIX6000, SunOS 4.X, HPUX, NeXT1.0, Dynix
 ... anywhere else cpp can output C source after macro expansion.
 Even an Amiga, I think.


What do I need to evaluate it?

 A C compiler, a /lib/cpp might help (but a -E option works).


Who would be interested in this kind of thing?

 Anyone who maintains C code.


Is this software restricted in distribution?

 No.  It has a Purdue Research Copyright, but that is just so you won't
 say you wrote it.


How much trouble is it to port?

 Not much.  About 1300 lines of C code, mostly stdio calls.


What's new since 3.3 (last real release)

 I added some ideas from Christian Marcotte, scoob@vlsi.polymtl.ca.
 His -z option is a little different, to get the same thing use -zl1
 on both versions.

 No one cares about tsort anymore, but I use it.  Don't ask why.  See -T.

Bugs:

 pfunc.sh and pblock.sh need work and a manual page.  I just put them in my
 bin for kicks...
	pfunc.sh - print a function by name from a list of source files
		+ might use a "tags" or "etags" file for example

	pblock.sh - produce a call in/out comment block, I'd never use one.
