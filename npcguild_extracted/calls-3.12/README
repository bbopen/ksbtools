This is the "calls" distribution which contains:
	calls - output the calling pattern of a C program
	maketd - use cpp -M like output to update transitive dependencies
	mkdep - maketd by another name
	cdecl - construct or explain C declarations (yacc/lex example too)

minus the bogus library (which has been moved to explode's library)
	libsrtunq - sorted and uniqued strings

Of these both maketd and calls are quite useful.  The mkdep (link to maketd)
entry emulates that program if you need that.  The cdecl program is OK
for teaching C declarations (to and from) and a fine example of abusing
lex and yacc.

The library was just here because maketd used it.  Now we explode it.

This is _ksb_ source.  You'll need the meta source stuff installed to
use it out of the box, or see the emulation instructions in the meta-source
distribution (msrc0).

You shall need mkcmd to compile almost anything I've written in the
last 10 years.  Anything over version 8.2 should work for this product.

We support (at leasr)
	HPUX NEXT2 NETBSD FREEBSD SUN5 SUN4 SUN3 EPIX IBMR2 IRIX
in calls/Makefile and maketd/Makefile.  Cdecl is not fully supported.

Calls bugs:
	Doesn't really parse C very well.  There is a more complex
	version that does C's parts of speach better.

Changes from 3.3 -> 3.10
	Mike MacKenzie's fix for an EOF botch in calls/scan.c.

	Suggested option (-z) to sort calls output in alpha order
	from Christian Marcotte.

	Bug fixes and such from ksb, of course.

	Uses explode to get srtunq.[ch] rather then the library.  Get
	mkcmd 8.2 or better for that reason alone.

	maketd is almost a total recode from the last release.

	cdecl has not changed at all, I think.
