The electronic submission tools are use, primarily, to fill up file
systems with copies of students files :-).

This is the `receive' end of this system, which allows graders to
choke many swallow5's to death in less than one term.  I have some
more bits to this system, helpful scripts and such if anyone cares.

The file "install.doc" is a typescript of someone (me) installing a
test course with project -i.

The "template" file is used to _grade_ student's projects.  Of course
running the project as the instructor would show a great amount of trust
between the prof. and the student.  Build a lesser acount and rcp/rsh
the binary in using .rhosts -- I would.
