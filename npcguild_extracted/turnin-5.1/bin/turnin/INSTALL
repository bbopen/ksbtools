Turnin(1L) and project(1L) provide administration of electronic
submissions for a large number of classes.  These tools may be applied
to any type of course (programming, art & design, word processing, etc.)
which requires `students' to submit `projects' to an `instructor'.

A `student' is any login name on a UNIX system.  Multiple logins under
the same uid are handled correctly.  The environment variables USER and
LOGNAME are consulted (in that order) to determine which login name is
submitting the file.

A `project' is a broad term for a group of submissions, one per login
name, which will be collected over time.  These may then be processed
by running a shell command for each project.   Submitted files are
stored in a tar(1) format archive.  Large archives are kept compressed,
but nether user nor administrator will see this detail.

An `instructor' is a supervising login name.  This login is able to
limit the collection time for any `project' and issue grade commands.

The user interface to turnin(1L) is quite simple and obvious.  The user
simply runs

	$ turnin files

to submit files.  If the request is ambiguous turnin will request
information from stdin.  Command line options are provides to suppress
such prompting.  Some profs use a simple (1 line) shell script to force
the course option on the user.  For example cs444 might use a script
`sub444' which reads:

	#!/bin/sh
	turnin -c cs444 "$@"

to `simplify' the user environment.

The user interface to project(1L) also quite simple.  The administrator
may enable a project with the -e option:

	project -e btrees

would enable a project called `btrees'. Or disable a project with the
-d option:

	project -d queues

After submissions for a project are complete (or even while some are
still coming in) the instructor may use the -g option to scan the
submitted files with a shell command.  The shell command is run once
for each login name who has submitted files.  Some percent (%) escapes
are substituted before the command is given to the shell.

	project -g "echo %u" queues

would scan the project `queues' and echo the login name of each user
who has submitted files.

Of course there are other options to project, but these three are by
far the most common.


Setting up the system.

The superuser must install 3 files in the user-accessible portion of
the UNIX system.

The binaries for project and turnin should be installed in the system's
default search path in something like /usr/local/bin or /usr/custom/bin.
The project binary should be mode 0755 (or 0711), the turnin binary
should be mode 04755 (or 04711) and owned by the superuser.  This is
because turnin must set-effective-uid to the target instructor on the
fly.  (It could be setuid to a single instructor, but the program is
useful to many instructors.)

There is a configuration file which should be superuser-writable only
(mode 0644, owned by the superuser).  This file tells the system which
logins are available to accept projects.  This file is installed in a
lib directory, usually /usr/local/lib or /usr/custom/lib, and is called
turnin.cf.  This file contains a colon-separated list of data very much
like the passwd file; there is a manual page for these fields
(turnin.cf.5L).
