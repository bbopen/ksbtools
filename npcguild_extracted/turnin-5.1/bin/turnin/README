This is an UPGRADED version of the 1993/1997 release of turnin.
This addresses a silly issue were a grader could read the first
30 odd lines of /etc/master.passwd (/etc/shadow) in some cases.
The other "bug" that Wenliang Du reports (that a grader's dot files
might be changed) is not fixable -- when you run code a student
wrote that can hurt you.


The electronic submission tools are use, primarily, to fill up file
systems with copies of students files :-).

This is the `send' end of this system.  See INSTALL for deatils.

The Student runs:
	$ turnin file.c main.c a.c

The Instructor (or grader) can run a command over all the submitted files.
 Easy.  You _should_ have an "op" rule to drop the student's running
program to "nobody" or some other vanilla account (or use ssh).
