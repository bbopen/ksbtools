The Purdue Engineering Computer Network had a few flavors of this
program before I stole the idea.  They don't care in any event.

You have to build a login called "terminal" that looks something like this:
	terminal::2:2:Remote Access:/usr/local/lib/remote:/usr/local/etc/remote

Edit the files "permok" and "motd" to allow what ever access you feel
is cool, and put a contact name in (you, not me).

Then install the shell (with make install) and the home direcrtory:
	make install
	make home

On a Solaris host you have to trick passwd into making a passwd-less login:
	passwd -d -l -x -1 terminal


Login on a console or hardwired tty device as "terminal" and you can
type in the name of an allowed host to gateway you.  On a bit mapped
device use the host "-x" to start a guest X11 session.  Try -?.


Because we have some "not so clever" mainframe people I have to lever
/etc/services to find the port number for the 3270 gateway.
Put this, or something like it, in your /etc/services:
	tn3270		2321/tcp	# local gateway port
