The tape shell is called tpsh.  When it used as a login shell it allows
a remote user to install a tape (usually sent from a remote admin) on
the local system.  The password on the account is usually changed
remotely to allow access only in a time boxed window (in an attempt to
limit the "break in" window).

This program is by NO MEANS safe to leave installed with a uid 0 account.
If you have even a hint at the source code one can code an "upgrade" that
installs a setuid program or adds a bogus super user account.

When installed as a normal user it is pretty safe to leave on all the time.
The normal user's home directory should be on a big partition to allow
sizeable distributions to stage files.

Features:
	Sending a 4G DAT or a 17G Exabyte or a 40G DLT saves a lot of
	line cost over a 28.8Kbps phone line.

	The upgrade can be co-ordinated over the phone so the remote admin
	knowns when to throw the switch to install the staged data OR
	the upgrade can be done when the local tech has time.

	There is an escape from the CUI model to allow additional features
	(like running system backups) from the shell.

	It is easy to turn off/on with a password change!
