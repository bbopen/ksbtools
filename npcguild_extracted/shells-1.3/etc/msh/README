When you need to tell someone they can't use the system change their
shell to:
	/usr/local/etc/msh

Then put a note in a file under their login name in 
	/var/spool/msh/$LOGIN
or by the group in
	/var/spool/msh/$GROUP
or make links to "msh" by other names and put the message in that name
	/var/spool/msh/msh   or   /var/spool/msh/frozen
Or they'll get
	/var/spool/msh/Default


After all those are exhausted (usually this means the spool directory
is not the correct mode) we output an internal message

	msh: Your shell is the message shell
	 There is no message in the spool directory for your login or group.
	 Contact your system administrator for assistance.


So they'll get some message when they login.  After you see a login or two
(or after a fixed amount of time) delete the account and the message.
