I'm not sure this is correct, but msh _might_ be the place to record
that they did see the message.  Maybe the mode on the message file should
be "+x" or something to me "e-mail the system admin when they login"?

We meybe should log (syslog) with at AUTH.NOTICE when someone gets a
mshell message?  This might be enough.
