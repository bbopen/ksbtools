These are the login shells I use to trap special users.  You might find
them useful someday.

msh -- The message shell (1.4)
	Trap a user then they login in a shell that only outputs a banner
	message then logs them out.  Great for those people who do not
	merrit an account or a phone call.

remote -- Allow remote access from a console (1.21)
	Setup a login "terminal" and let people use the console of a box
	to start a dumb terminal emulation or an X session, or even a
	3270 session.  Useful when guests are at the site and want to
	"telnet" home.  Well, if you have a firewall you have other problems.

tpsh -- Tape spooller shell (2.8)
	Setup a login that can install software from a tape, or backup
	a host, or do just about anything.

	This is a major security problem if the account password gets into
	the wrong hands!  Don't leave "tpsh" up with a superuser uid and
	a well known or bad password.  I'm not to blame, really.

These are handy and I've used them all at least 3 times.  I think
"remote" is really nifty, myself.
