Clever labstat commands:

$ labstat -ax | grep '[UD][EN][AS][DE]'
	show DEAD or UNSEEN hosts and last report time for them.

$ labstat -al | awk '{ if ($3 > 0.99) { print $0; }} '
	show hosts with a load greater than 0.99.

$ labstat lv426
	give a simple status line for lv426 only

$ labstat +enad135 -f | less
	give a visual picture of the NFS balance in a 1st floor lab

$ rlogin `labstat -W`
	login to an idle client


Labstat outputs a snap-shot of the current client status.  Status information
may be filtered to output only interesting machines.  Information is at most
about 7 minutes old.

We use labstat to scan for high loads, look for idle machine to login to,
and look for console logins that have been on longer than local policy
provides (-al, -W, -az120).
