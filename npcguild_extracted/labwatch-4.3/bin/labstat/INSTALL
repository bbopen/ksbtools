This program won't do you much good without a labwatch server up and running
that you can see.  If you don't have a labwatch server up you can view data
from ours (feinfo.cc.purdue.edu) with this program.

To install this program you *have* to have mkcmd 7.1 or better installed
somepace on the local host.  Mkcmd builds the shell level user interface
from the file that end in dot-m.  Without it you could spend hours coding.
Mkcmd pre 7.1 doesn't understand `augment' (about line 80 in labstat.m) and
will choke on it.  Just comment out that hunk with `#' if you have mkcmd
6.30.  If you have mkcmd < 6.30 you have to upgrade.


To build labstat:

Edit the Makefile to change `CC' and `CDEFS'.  The macro `CC' should be
either the local C compiler or gcc.  Some special cases:
	IBMR2	bsdcc
	EPIX	cc -systype bsd43
	others	gcc -fwritable-strings
	or	cc
	
The macro CDEFS should contain a definition for the labwatch servers you
want to poll:
	-DDEF_MASTER=\"host1,host2,host3\"
And a -Dtype where `type' is one of
	type		for OS like
	VAX8800		Ultrix
	S81		Dynix 3.0
	EPIX		EP/IX
	IBMR2		AIX
	SUN3		Sunos 4.1.1
	SUN4		Sunos 4.1.3
	SUN5		Solaris 2.3
	NEXT2		Older NeXTStep

So we might have (in the Makefile)
	CDEFS= -DSUN4 -DDEF_MASTER=\"bubbles.ftl.com\"
	CC=gcc -fwritable-strings

Then type
	make
if you get `strtol' as an unreferenced symbol add strtol.o to the OBJ macro
(and re-make).


You have to put the services line in from labwatch, repeated here
for your amusement:
	labinfo		785/tcp				# PUCC labwatch output
	lablisten	784/udp		lablog		# PUCC labwatch listen
then run `labstat -V'


Install labstat in /usr/local/bin (make install) or anyplace else.
