This is the labwatch package.  It is an add-on to the console server
(or I guess you could run it w/o the console server) that lets operation
monitor _lots_ of client machines in remote locations for uptime and
problems.

It is intended to produce some real time notification for almost any
problem a client is likely to have (missing network parts included).
As a side effect the clients report low load averages to a "heap" that
would let people or progams select an "idle" client to run a job on.


That parts:
	labstat Four - the user interface to find out "stuff" about clients.
		Admins use it to find problems, user solutions.

	labwatch Three - the operations interface.  Usually run on a virtural
		console through the console server, but could be on a
		real console (dumb terminal, xterm, anything).
		Spews realtime message for operation on stdout.

	labd Three - the client automation.  Runs all the time (very light CPU
		load, like 7 seconds a day or less) sending little UPD
		packets to labwatch.

	labc Two - an optional client agent for real time messages directed to
		operations (like RSTS "please"), NOT a replacement for syslog

	labwatch.cf One - example configuration file and manual page

	docs - some operations notes we've use at Purdue.


Follow the INSTALL notes and you should be able to install it, you will need
mkcmd-7.21 or better to build it (of course).
