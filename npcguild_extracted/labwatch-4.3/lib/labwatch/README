These are sample configuration files for labwatch.  Assist.cc is a file
server with almost 200 IPC clients.  Extra.cc is a Sun3 file server
with a handfull of old 3/50 workstation for staff to use.  Symphony.cc
is the central file server for the public NeXT lab (its labwatch runs
on console.cc).

The `$Compile' targets at the top of each file are markers for the
local mk program.  Hence `mk file.cf' runs labwatch with apropos
options for that file.
