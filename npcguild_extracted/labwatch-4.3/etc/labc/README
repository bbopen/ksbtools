This code is part of the labd/labwatch/labstat system by Ben Jackson
and Kevin Braunsdorf.

This program controls individual client agents.  One can shoot them,
poll them, redirect them (or what have you).  The interaction is very
low-level, only a few commands are probably useful for real
applications, the rest are mostly for debugging (the programs and the
site installtion).
