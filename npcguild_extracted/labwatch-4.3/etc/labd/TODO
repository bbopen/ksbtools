bj: replace USERFS_PREFIX with USERFS_MAPFUNC or something.  write mappings
    to do USERFS_PREFIX and /home/machine/letter.

ksb: add passive mode (-p).  labd reports once to labwatch with a special
 "passive" tag in the packet (p:ackport).  labwatch has a heap of passive
 clients and polls them every <passive> seconds.  This is for demand dial
 networks that only dial in one direction (from labwatch -> labd).
 Passive clients:
	+ keep a few messages in a buffer and deliver them when polled
	+ still expect an ACK for each report packet (the network connection
	  should stay up for at least 6 seconds after a poll to deliver
	  messages)
