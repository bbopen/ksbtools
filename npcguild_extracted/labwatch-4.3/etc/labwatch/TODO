fix -T and do something with unique users

make ops cmd to reload map part of config file (all of config file?)

make "passive clients" work (asymetric networks like dial nets)
	+ server polls every so often
	+ clients are not dead as easy
	- not as good a check and might need advanced timer support
	- how do we denote a passive client in the expect list?
