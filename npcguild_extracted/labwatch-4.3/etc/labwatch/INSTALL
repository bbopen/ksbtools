Add these lines to /etc/services (on your NIS master if you've got one):
	lablisten	784/udp lablog		# host stat chat to labwatch
	labinfo		785/tcp labstat		# client info chat to labwatch

Compile this program and install it 755 (or 744) in /usr/local/etc.
Build a configuration file (see ../../lib/labwatch.cf) and run the
program with the configuration file as
	labwatch -n -C /usr/local/lib/labwatch.cf

Any labd's started with the server you ran labwatch on as the target will
report problems the stdout of the running labwatch.  Stdin of the running
labwatch is a micro-shell with some commands for Ops.  Type "help" for more
commands you might want to learn.

Install any automation using "labc" on the clients and test it.  For example
a client should start labd on boot (in rc.local, rc, or init.d).  It might send
an explict message to Ops (with labc "message stuff here") if some well known
problem happens in production.  Such messages should tell the (human) Ops
Dude _what_ to do, not just complain at them.

See the INSTALL notes at the package level for more clues.
