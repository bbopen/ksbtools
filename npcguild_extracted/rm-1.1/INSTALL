After you've install the basic entombing system (libtomb.a, entomb,
unrm, preend, rmfile, untmp) you should add this package of Berkeley
software compiled with -ltomb to enable user level entombing.

I'd never tell you to replace /bin/rm or /bin/mv!  Rather build a
directory like /usr/local/safety and install these there.  Well, you can
replace /bin/rm but /bin/mv is STATICALLY linked on some systems for a
reason -- use "file /bin/mv" to check and you might have to fix the
Make.host makefile in bin/mv/Make.host.

This is tricky stuff, but when it works it can save you tens of file
restores a month on a busy (novice user) system.

Play it safe, and it is _not_ my fault.

Note: The FreeBSD guys added -P and -d to rm, this one doen't have it.
They also use the nasty "errx" stuff so there code will _never_ build
any place elese, at least mkcmd runs on most platforms.  So there.
