This is the Berkeley source to rm/mv/cp as it was a few years ago.
I (Kevin Braunsdorf) put in the "-ltomb" and the master source stuff.
Bugs in this are possible, since it is so old.

After you've installed entombing you can install this package to
build an rm, mv, and cp that entomb.  Install them in /bin only if
you are sure (make _sure_ mv is loaded static on a Sun/Solaris system).

I didn't tell you this would make your system better.  It might not
help you out at all.  You'd be safer with the power set to "0".  Really.
