This is the source to mkcmd (make command) and explode (the MICE module
unpacker).  You shall need mkcmd to compile almost anything I've written
in the last 10 years.  Anything over version 8.5 should work for all
products.


Get "msrc0-0.5.tgz" first!
--------------------------


Before you build this you need to get "msrc0-0.5" or so and use it
to start the "meta source" stuff on your hosts.   If you don't do that
you will never get any of these nice toys to build.  For sure.

Bugs:
	The order of some of the arrays is not optimal for humans.
