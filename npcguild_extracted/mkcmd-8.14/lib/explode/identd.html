<H1>Introduction</H1>

<ACRONYM TITLE="request for comments">RFC</ACRONYM> 1413
describes how to find out which login <EM>might</EM> own a TCP/IP connection
(since 931 has been obsoleted).  This is mostly
useful for audit logs because it might be encoded or abstracted in some
way

<P>
Your application should <STRONG>not</STRONG> depend on this routine
as the only source of authentication (the login name found might not
be a plain-text login name).

<H1>Configuration</H1>

A C Preprocessor macro is the only tuning one might do (for testing).

<DL>
<DT>IDENT_PORT
<DD>
The default TAP port, usually 113.
</DL>

<H1>Provides</H1>

A single call to get the ident return value.
<DL>
<DT>
int ident_client(struct sockaddr_in peeraddr, struct sockaddr_in ouraddr, char pcIdent[1024])
<DD>
Uses the two <CODE>socaddr_in</CODE>'s to request a TAP, returns the
TAP data in the 1k buffer provided.
<DT>main
<DD>
A simple reflector test driver that listens on port 7098 for telnet connections.
It TAPs them and outputs the incoming login name.
</DL>

<H1>To Do List</H1>

Because this can block (forever) it should be async, or take a timeout value.
Maybe set as a global variable?  Not added to the parameter list, for sure.
