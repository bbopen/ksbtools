Explode comes with some useful example code (useful in that
ksb's tools need these to compile).  As examples go they are
pretty mundane.

<P>
Here is a list of them for you to poke through:
<DL>
<P><DT><A HREF="avl.html">Adelson-Velskii Landis Height-Balanced Trees</A>
<DD>
Impress your friends with a cool sounding data structure!
These RAM-based trees provide a quick average time insert, delete, find
scheme and are very low overhead.
<P><DT><A HREF="ckpass.html">Password checking code</A>
<DD>
After a Customer gives you a password (UNIX style) how do you make
sure it is the correct one?  This case can tell you.
<P><DT><A HREF="identd.html">Identd C interface (TAP)</A>
<DD>
You call getpeername(2) to find the host and port, but this might
tell you the login name (or hash name) of the connected user!
Use only as directed.
<P><DT><A HREF="scandir.html">BSD Implementation of scandir for Non-BSD systems</A>
<DD>
Just what it says.  Compiles on Solaris for example.
<P><DT><A HREF="srtunq.html">Sorted, unique C strings</A>
<DD>
These are really cheap, I mean <STRONG>really</STRONG> cheap.
Just a way to keep track of a list of unique strings so we
don't repeat ourself.
</DL>

<P>
Others will be added in new releases.
