examples:
	A better enum example?

types:
	Code a type for a "filesystem" (like df), find the mount pt. at least.
	
	Code a type for a "mode" like chmod or umask (install has the code)

	Code a type for a "signal", include "kill -l" example.

	Code a types for a IPC objects "semaphore", "shared memory", 
	"message queue".

std:

cmd:

rc:
	The RC files should read values for "-o macros" in some easy
	to understand format (maybe wam's text encoding) (macro_read.m?).
	It should take a (FILE *) and read macro -- hey, the cmd_macro.m
	already has an interface like this.  Hummm.

util:
	util_mult.m example should be "mkfile".

xdr:
	We should be able to send a (FILE *) across a remote procedure
	call.  xdr_Cstream should encode a file for read or write as a
		host:port:key
	and put a process up on host:port waiting for "key" to send the
	file.  On the decode end we connect a socket to host:port and write
	"key\n" then fdopen the socket.  How do we specify the direction?
	I assume the file is already open, might be a process or whatnot.
	Issues... sigh.

	To encode a "file" (read/write/seek) we have to do the rmt thing.
	The stream abstraction would be read or write only, but useful for
	config files and setup for long exchanges.  We'd have to use a
	more advanced interface to the stdio stream structure.
