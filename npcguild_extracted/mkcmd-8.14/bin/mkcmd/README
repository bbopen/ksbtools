Here at PUCC (The Purdue University Computing Center) we administer
lots of UNIX platforms.  We sometimes have to run off quick tools to
solve problems for our customers.  This program lets us build a nifty
command line option parser and some on-line documentation in a snap.


First edit the Makefile here to change `/usr/local/lib/mkcmd' and
`/usr/local/bin' if you do not want to install this program under
/usr/local.  You can look at other tuning params in "machine.h" and
override them in CDEFS in the Makefile.
	vi Makefile

Build mkcmd:
	make all

Install mkcmd:
	make install

If you have mkcat (a PUCC tool to install manual pages):
	mkcat mkcmd.man

Install the library files:
	(cd ../lib; make install)

Test mkcmd:
	make self

Read the Notes file again, try some stuff from ../../examples.

Send bugs with a *.m file to me.  Patches are OK too :-).
