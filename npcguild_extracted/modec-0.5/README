This package is a little harder to build.  You have to have the
"install" package installed, and "vinst" needs to reuse code out
of that package's instck program.

If you unpack this and build it you'll only get "sbp", which would
be well worth it.  If you mv the "vinst" directory into /usr/msrc
where it goes it'll build (/usr/msrc/local/bin/vinst) or if you
tell it (via LOCALSRC=/usr/src/Pkgs/install-8.5) where the install
source is, you can build it as well.

For example I build the "intall" package in /usr/src/Pkgs on my
workstation, then ran:
	$ /usr/src/Pkgs/modec-0.5/bin/vinst
	$ make clean
	$ PATH=/usr/local/etc:/usr/local/bin:$PATH
	$ make LOCALSRC=/usr/src/Pkgs/install
	$ ./vinst -V
	vinst: $Id: vinst.m,v 1.14 1999/06/01 17:27:17 ksb ...
	vinst: default shell /usr/local/bin/ksh
	vinst: install path /usr/local/bin/install
	vinst: installus path /usr/local/etc/installus
	vinst: vi path /usr/bin/vi
	vinst: diff path /usr/bin/diff
	vinst: instck path /usr/local/etc/instck
	$ su
	# make install

The modecanon program itself is far too dangerous in its present
state to release.  Someday, soon.  I've trashed 2 hosts with it...

Read the INSTALl in sbp for lots of cool ideas to use it.  I've
wrapped "vinst -U" several time to solve access problems.
