This is meta source.  You have to know all about ksb's master source
system for maintaining products across many platforms and how the
packaging of the meta source system works to make this do anything
good for you.

You also need "mkcmd" installed to build anything I work on.  Really.


This presents an API to get pseudo ttys from a daemon that runs as
root.  The daemon can be sure that you are who you claim to be by
use of the file system (no access rights, which break most System V
kernels).

The daemon (ptyd) with build and remove utmp and wtmp records for
the pty's login user on request.  It frees idle pty/tty pairs when
_anyone_ runs "ptyd -c" (which you can put in /etc/daily or so).

Install "lib/libptyd" and "etc/ptyd".  Run /usr/local/etc/ptyd.
Build "bin/script" and try that, it can build a utmp entry now:
	host$ ./script -u /tmp/r$$
	$ tty
	$ ls -las `tty`
	$ who
	$ exit

Script should build on at least FreeBSD, and with a little porting
on lots of others.
