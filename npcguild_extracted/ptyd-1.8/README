This almost forgotten code lets user level programs get pseudo
tty devices owned by themselves w/o being root.  Plus they can
(and should) get a utmp entry.

The daemon that does it is small and simple.  No root breaking
allowed.

Install libpty, ptyd, and upgrade script to one that can get a
utmp entry.  Wow!  Xterm used to have #if's to use this, it might
still as far as I know.  rlogind, telnet, and a few others were
easy to "upgrade" last time I looked.
