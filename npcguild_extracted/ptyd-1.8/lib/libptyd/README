I think this is a fine way to get pseudo ttys.  I coded it way back
in early Oct 1989.  Originally people were picking it up and I
thought it might work.  The BSD boys said "pseudo ttys were a botch
and we are going to rip them out".  So I quit pushing it.

Right.

It is 1997 and we use more pseudos than ever.  Time to dust this
off and get more people to use it.  Xterm still had #if's for it
last time I looked.

Thanks to Mike Rowen for some of the work in this.
