I needed "apply" to do a project under HPUX and HPUX 9.05 didn't have
it.  So I went to get the FreeBSD one and it uses a _brain_ _damaged_
err()/errx() hack in crt0.c and libc.  Eak!

So I coded a better one and will just drag it around with me.  Runs
under (at least) SunOS, AIX, IRIX, HPUX, and FreeBSD.

The -P option is stolen from the Dynix 3 system as I remember it:  if
you don't give one you get 1 task, -P gives you $PARALLEL with a default
3 if the variable is not set.  Or -Pn gives you n, of course.  Try -P10
on most machines.

I use something like
	find /tmp $cruft_files_spec -print | xapply -fP5 -7 rm - - - - - - -
to clean up /tmp.  This pumps as it keeps 5 /bin/rm's running and
keeps reading files the whole time.  Even faster than xargs.
