These depend on mkcmd in a big way.  You'll need the meta source stuff
installed on you master source host to push them in any automated fassion.

Just make to your test machines
	make HOSTS=-m$TEST_BOX all

Play with them in the source if you like and install them.  There are
even manual pages.

Xapply 3.X is much more useful than 2.X and I've fixed the N+1 process
bug (which only I noticed).
