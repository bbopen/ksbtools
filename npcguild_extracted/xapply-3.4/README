[You'll need msrc0 and mkcmd if you've not done this before. -- ksb]

This package contains the source to three of my lesser works for
advanced process and pipe management.

xapply	version Three (3.2)
	Replaces both xargs and apply in one better tool.

	Extended apply does most everything apply does, and all the
	best parts of xargs.  It should take the GNU `-null' switch to
	handle input from GNU find.  [But doesn't.]

	Version 3.X has a nice string chopper that makes taking passwd
	file-like or email addresses a snap. (E.g. %[3@1] is the login
	part of the third email address.)

curly	version Three (3.3)
uncurly
	Expand a list of filenames (strings) like the csh(1) curly brace
	list does.  Uncurly "undoes" this to build a such an expression.
	This is handy to store long lists in a compressed format.

Tee	version Two (2.5)
	Replaces /bin/tee with a program for bigger jobs.  Will handle
	as many file descriptors as the kernel will open (forks to get
	more when a single process won't do) and will write to processes
	on a pipe (Tee '|wc -l') to replace most of what people use perl
	for :-).

flock	version Two (2.5) [Featured in a magazine a while back.]
	Lock a file and run shell command.  Used to sync unrelated
	processes (such as those started by Tee or xapply).

in a later release I'll include the others like this.  But not yet.
