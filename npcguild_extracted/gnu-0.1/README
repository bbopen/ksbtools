This is the example interface for the GNU products into the master
source system.  I put the tar archives in "~ftp/pub/gnu" but since the
shell (/bin/sh) doesn't do tilde expansion they are spelled out in the
example Makefile's.

So you'll have to change  "/home/dspd6/ftp" to /usr/ftp or some other
place where you keep the GNU tar files).

If you have the distrib infrastructure installed you should be able to
type
	make HOSTS=-m$TARGET install

from any of the three example directories to install the product.

These are the three example products
	rdist-6.1.3	(from mcooper at usc.edu)
	gzip-1.2.4	(from the prep.ai.mit.edu archive)
	screen-3.7.2	(also from prep.ai.mit.edu)

I put in some "clues" as to how one might
	+ "hack" the source after it is untar'd (with /bin/ed or patch)
	+ force configure options like --prefix
	+ clean up after yourself

If you use the template Makefiles from msrc-4.16's Admin/templates/gnu.host
and meta you should be set to build any others you need.
