We need a host that doesn't run a conserver to use as the master
dispatcher so it can be restarted to add hosts at will.  s01.sa.fedex.com
might be that machine.

In addition the console servers, this config goes too (V 7.5):

	info.sa.fedex.com		<- should be the default conserver

	chalktalk.dpd.fedex.com		<- default for lots of people
	consit.prod.fedex.com
	gumby.dpd.fedex.com
	kachina.dpd.fedex.com
	s03.sa.fedex.com

and these are out of revision on the binary
	dscm-arc1			7.0
	pokey.dpd.fedex.com		7.1
