Prep:

 Start in the conserver directory.

 Now read conserver.cf.5l (if you have mk(1L) installed just mk it).
 Run:
	$  tbl conserver.cf.5l |nroff -man |${PAGER-more}

 Now edit dummy.cf and follow the instructions there.
 [If you are just shopping stop here.]

 Now edit conserver.cf and put your real hosts in there.

 Edit the Makefile and change LIB.


Compile:

 None.


Install:

 Make install.

Activate a Central Data Mux.

 Follow the install process they provide.  Make the nodes with something like:
	cdmknods -product ST-1616 -mode dialin -target 1
 then you might need a cdflush or cdmdmctl (where did this command go?)
 to init the lines in the boot sequence.
