Prep:

 Did you do the prep work in ../conserver yet?  If not please start there.


Compiling:

 Try a
	make
 in this directory.  If cons.h is correct this should just compile.


First test:

 Run a version command:
	./console -V
 and see something like:

	console: <$>Id: console.m,v 7.3 1995/06/26 21:41:21 kb207252 Alpha $
	console: initial master server `console.cc.purdue.edu'
	console: default escape sequence `^Ec'
	console: loopback address for dscmsvr6 is 127.0.0.1
	console: service name `console' (which we call `conserver') on port 782

 Finish the INSTALL in conserver now.


Connect to the conserver on your dumb port,

 Try all the commands.  Especially ^Ecz and ^Ecd/^Eco.

 Try two connections to the same console, note the cool way you can force
 the other guy off (^Ecf).
