To install the BSD install replacement:

1) read the manual pages

2) edit the file `configure.h' and read about the site options
   you may or may not want to turn on
	+ syslog installs by the superuser
	+ check a list of files and modes to assure important files
		are not lost || miss installed
	+ the name of some routines (getwd)
	+ how default modes are built
		- inherit from destination directory
		- use compiled-in defaults
	+ can source be a symlink (SLINKOK)
	+ maybe define some defaults: (override those in install.h)
		DEF{OWNER,GROUP,MODE}		- file modes
		DEFDIR{OWNER,GROUP,MODE}	- directory modes
		ODIR{OWNER,GROUP,MODE}		- OLD file modes
		OLDDIR				- name of OLD

3) look over install.cf (if you are going to be using CONFIG)

4) make depend if you have it
	make depend
	maketd -a *.c
	mkdep *.c
  or some such

5) make the binary
	make all

6) run
	./installp -V
   as a user to be sure you have the defaults the way you
   like them.

7) Look at the Makefile for where it would be installed
	${DESTDIR}/${BIN}/install    [and such]
   you might want to edit these a little.  We don't replace the SYSV
   install with its funky $PATH search -- yucko.

8) make install, and install the install.cf you want (also see the
   notes in ../../lib/install.cf).  We touch an empty one if you don't
   have anything installed.

9) run some tests:
	install -vn -o fred /dev/null /etc/passwd
	install -vn /etc/motd /dev/null
	install -d -vn /tmp
	install -vn -m7555 /etc/motd /bin/sh
	install -vn -m666 /etc/motd /etc/passwd
   these should all report some kind of error would happen, if the
   install.cf I use is in place.

10) make clean

That should about do it.
