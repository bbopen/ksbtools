# Example .owners file for new installations (no installus -I yet). -- ksb
#
# Install this file in /usr/local/bin or /opt/gnu/bin or some such to let
# normal users install their favorite programs.  This takes a lot of work
# off the local SysAdmin (and lets the users Trojan Horse each other, so
# don't put jerks in the file).
#
# You'll want to include lines like this for each product owned by a user:
gcc	ksb.*		-m 755 -o root -g unsup
#
# Which lets me (ksb) install gcc in the target directory mode 755 root.unsup.
# This would be cool [because I'm a Nice Guy].
#
# For more "bang" you can give _every_ remaining file to a group.  Then put
# the Users you trust in the group:
*	*.unsup		-m 755 -o root -g unsup
#
# For even more power use the "**" glob which falls into subdirs
**	*.unsup		-m 755 -o root -g unsup
**/	*.unsup		-d -m 755 -o root -g unsup
#
# That is way powerful. See the manual pages on how to remove the password
# prompt for special installs (clue: setuid on .owners) -- ksb
