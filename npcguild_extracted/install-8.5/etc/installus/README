Several tools give limited "superuser" or "transuser" privileges based
on group membership or a password:  su, newgrp, sudo, op, and this
program all take slightly different views.

Su and newgrp give you a shell at the cost of a password (and maybe
you have to be in a special group in some cases).

Sudo and op let you run a single command for the cost of a password
and/or a group membership.  This is safter than "su" because the list
of commands usually doesn't include anything that will give you a
shell.

Installus is even more limited -- you can update files and directories.
They have to have modes we set in advance and we make a backout copy
just in case you are confused.  The at the cost of a password or group
membership (maybe both).


Why is this "better"? 
      + It can be setup to work from a Makefile w/o a password.  

      + The configuration is "per" directory (unlike the others) so
	different unrelated user populations don't mess with eachother.

      + The configuration to do the same things is _huge_ using other tools
	and hard to use (or you have to build a front end process that sends
	in stuff with environment variables).

The prototype script "mkowner.ksh" builds .owners file to get you started.
Thanks to Dan Lebovitz who coded it with me.

N.B.: on FreeBSD we default to the "MD5" passwd hash.  Most US Domestic
    installs use the DES crypt hash and must insert the "USE_MD5" forced
    define in CDEFS in the Make.host Makefile.  Viz. make it look like
		 CDEFS= -DFREEBSD -DUSE_MD5=0
