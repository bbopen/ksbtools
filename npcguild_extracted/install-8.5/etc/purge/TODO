If purge is given a plain file, say `/bin/poker', it should look in the
apropos OLD directory `/bin/OLD' for backup files of `poker'. Pruning
these from the OLD directory but preserving other OLD files.  Should this
look at stronger criteria that strncmp?  See the comment above "Which".
[I think the mktemp template's + 6 character might save us here a little.]

It has been suggested that purge might get a slightly different criteria to
purge under in some cases.  An option to force all but one copy of each
preserved file to be removed (with little or no reguard to age).

	$ purge -h
	...
	1	keep only the backup with the same name as the original

I'm not so sure this is a great idea.  There is a good chance that the one
we want to get back is the *older* of the backups -- not the previous
botched version.  Save me from `purge -i'?

Also, if we did `purge -i' we could fork off the `instck -i' we tell the
user to run ourselves.  Which would make us look so smart.

One last nit: purge is run by ops to clear space on /usr when it is
nearly full.  A flag (`-x') to say ``Do not cross device bounds.''
might speed this up.

All this is beyond the scope of the original shell script we are emulating,
but would be used once in a while.  I'll put it in my list at 9 prio.
