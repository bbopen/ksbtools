Most of the leverage we need to be portable and have a common user
interface is stored here.

	Makefile	recover source from RCS
	common.h	C leverage to finding header files and OS features
	qfuncs.i	C code to manupilate the queues
	qsys.m		command line options most programs support

	config-info.sh	run this after you edit qpaths.sh to check your work
	README		this file
