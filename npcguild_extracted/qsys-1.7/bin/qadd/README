This program adds tasks to a queue.  The shell commands to run the task are
provided as a _single_word_ on the command line, or as stdin (much better
interface).

So the shell command
	$ qadd 'touch /tmp/i-ran-boss'

touches the file "/tmp/i-ran-boss" in less than about 2 minutes.  I think
a better interface is
	$ qadd -N "rebuild catd"
	qadd> cd /usr/src/local/etc/catd
	qadd> make all install clean
	qadd> rdist -c /usr/local/etc/catd server:
	qadd> ^D
	[EOT]
	$ exit

Note the "qadd>" prompt, this builds a job named "rebuild catd" in the queue
(see qstat) which executes there commands in a sh(1).  If you'd like to see
the output of the job you can add `-m $USER' to the command line above.


Bugs:
	- qadd is less-than-friendly when you give it more words on
	the command line.  They become $0 $1 $2 $3... to the shell processes
	the first command given.  This could be useful -- if you had
	some unresolved feelings for /bin/sh.

	- qadd should default to sending you mail, maybe.  You can do this
	with the option environment variable "QADD" set to "-m me".

	- qadd takes too long to insert commands in the queue, because
	it wraps them in a short C program.
