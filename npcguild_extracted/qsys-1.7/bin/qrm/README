Qrm removes tasks from the system queues.  If the job it running it
forks a qkill to clean the job out of the process table.  Nasty.

Usually the Owner of the job notices that the commands listed in
the qstat output don't look right.  Then she removes the task and
requeues.  The qkill stuff only happens if qmgr and the owner race.

Bugs:
	- qrm should have an `everything I own' option
