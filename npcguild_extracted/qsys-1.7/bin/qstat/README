Qstat produces one of three nice output lines for each task in a
queue.  This program monitors the status of your jobs for you.


When there are no tasks in the queue it says:
	zero files in queue

When a task is waiting to be launched:
	Rank  Job   Who        Date     Nice    Command
	  1  k01  ksb      Feb 11 13:42  10 sleep 600;

When a task is running:
	Rank  Job   Who        Date     Nice    Command
	run 14871 ksb      Feb 11 13:42   0 sleep 600;

And under -v when a task is running it shows an extra line with the host:
	Rank  Job   Who        Date     Nice    Command
	run 14871 ksb      Feb 11 13:42   0 sleep 600;
	    lv426          Feb 11 13:43  10

The values are pretty clear, except maybe for the 2 nice values.  The first
line's Nice value represents any nice adjustment to be made in the future.
The -v second line show the total nice adjustment made.
