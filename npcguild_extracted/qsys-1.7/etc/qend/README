Qend is supposed to shut the queue system down neatly (stop on a dime!).
It enqueues a job which signals the qmgr running the queue with a TERM.
The qmgr should respond by refusing to start new jobs, and after all the
running jobs quit it should terminate neatly.

Of course it takes the TERM on the chin now and croaks.  I'll get around
to adding the signal handler in qmgr soon...  maybe.
