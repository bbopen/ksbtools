The program may be used to lock a queue system queue, for example one might
lock a queue that was gone.  I can't think of any other uses for it.

	qlock -d short "We don't have any short jobs anymore, use long. -- Bob"

Might be a kinda useful hint.  Hey, I wrote it because the Customer
wanted it.

The lock will _not_ survive a reboot because the death of the qlock process
removes the lock.
