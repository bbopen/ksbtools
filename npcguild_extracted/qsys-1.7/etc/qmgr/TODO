What could we do with an interactive interface to the qmgr?
Could we make a command to `drop' a job, or to run the next one (poll now)?

How many commands?
	add		add a job
	concurent #	set the number of concurent jobs to #
	kill		terminate a running job
	lock "message"	lock the queue qith qlock
	poll		force a scan of the queue (default command)
	rm		remove a job
	shutdown	wait for all jobs to finish and exit
	source		read a file of commands
	stat		run qstat (or emulate it)
	stop/start	enable/disable polling for jobs (automatically)
	unlock		remove a qlock lock
	version		output a version string
