Qinit builds a queue system queue (in the default queue directory)
for the names given on the command line.  It builds the default system
queue if none are provided.

A queue may have a file ".q-opts" which qstart takes as a short shell
script to launch the qmgr with (special options to qmgr for example).
Qstart feeds this script to the `su' process.  Qinit complains if it
sees one of these.

No known bugs.
