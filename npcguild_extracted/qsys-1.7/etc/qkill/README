Qkill should not be needed.  But when we try to shoot the process group
of a running queue jobs we do not always get the whole thing.  This
program traverses the process table to signal all the jobs in the tree
under the job.

It runs setgid kmem, but that doesn't let it shoot any system process.
It is safe to install as far as I can tell.  If it doesn't traverse your
process table correctly send me some mail.
