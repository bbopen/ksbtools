This file will have to be site configured, at least.  But it is really
simple.  Don't panic.


Qstart is run from /etc/rc.local (or /etc/rc's localrc function, or from
/etc/inittab) to fire up the queue system.  It runs as root but drops (with
su) to the queue master login.  This is kinda a bug -- we don't want the
groups of the queue master, but a safe login name and the qmgr group.

So we look in the Q_SPOOL directory for all the subdirectories that are
group owned by Q_GROUP (qmgr) and fire a qmgr process off in each.  If there
is a .q-opts file in one we use that file as a shell script to run to fire
up qmgr.  You should be happy I didn't use mk(1) here.  I would have, you
know.

Edit this file, if you wish.  But mostly you can build .q-opts files in the
queue's to change things.
