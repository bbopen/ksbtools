This is my little job system.  It keeps a machine loaded with jobs,
but doesn't let too many run at once.   It is great for queue for
Crack runs, or lots of Ada compiles.  If you use an NFS (or AFS)
mounted common queue area you can even spread the load out over
multiple hosts.

Not as fancy as NQS or any of those Monsters.  Only requires *setgid*
to a unique group.  No setuid root work is done (in fact the stuff
is launched as `daemon' just to be sure).

The docs are not great, but follow a long and you'll get the idea.
Each part has a README telling how it fits into the whole and a manual
page telling what you can do with it.
