 This files in this directory are for the creation of a "libtomb".  What
happens is that we create libtomb.a, which contains the functions "open",
"creat", "unlink", "rename", and "truncate".  These functions are the ones
user's of this library link their programs to, and they fork and exec the
setuid "entomb" program.

 The tricky part is getting the functions to call the real libc functions
after they fork when the time comes to actually unlink, etc. the file in
question.  So we use syscall.
