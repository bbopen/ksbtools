Hi,

This is the _meta_source_ distribution of the version 7.3 Gamma release of
ksb's console server and autologin products.  This code is free for any and
all uses -- just don't claim you wrote it and don't hold me liable if Bad
Things happen to you.

If you don't have mkcmd-7.24 or better you are not going to be able to build any
part of this.

If you don't have distrib and the meta source stuff up on your source machines
you are hopelessly out of your element -- but I've stopped including the
makefiles */remote.mk which *might* build a working makefile for you.  Use
the "msrc0" package to fake it if you must.

If you want distrib and the meta source stuff I'm working on a good release
even as I type this.  If you don't have _any_ idea why you might want the meta
source stuff you are not ready for it.  :-|

Try (replace SUN5 with any of the targets after "all" in remote.mk):
	$ cd etc/console
	$ makeme
	$ cd ../conserver
	$ makeme
	$ cd ../autologin
	$ makeme
