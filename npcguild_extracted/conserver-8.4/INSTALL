See the INSTALL files in the subdirectories.

This application allows you to monitor and interact with serial
devices in your machine room from home.  It can save a lot of
drive-time.

It is used all over the place.  Greg Becker and KS Braunsdorf are
still working on it, comments to ksb@sa.fedex.com.  As far as we
know it is fully Y2K ready.


Fair warning: you will need mkcmd-8.6 or better to build this, and
you're going to have to learn msrc to make your life Happy again.
