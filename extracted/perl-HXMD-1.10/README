HXMD version 1.8
=================

This module provide access to hxmd's configuration data from perl
scripts.  This can be really handy for gerating reports that would
be hard to summarize from parallel shell operations.  As as side-
effect distrib configuration files (which are in the same format)
are also covered.

There is a simple output function included to help convert an input
configuration to some other output format.  This is most useful for
merge operations, or to add (empty?) columns to a configuration file.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:
   perl Makefile.PL

DEPENDENCIES
