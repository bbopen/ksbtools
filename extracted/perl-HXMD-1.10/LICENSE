You can stop reading here.  The rest of this is non-binding opinion.
Please contribute to this Software in a constructive light:

+ Keep your versions distinct -- if you are making changes to the
  Software you should mark the fact it is not the same as the package
  you got (especially when you release the modified version).

  All these programs have revision control tags in them: you should
  choose a way to mark your changes.  A unique keyword/tag would
  be great (like MyDomain).

+ Send bug reports back to me -- bugs at spam dot npcguild dot
  org =~ s/spam/ksb/.  I must obfuscate the address to cut down on
  the spam I get from these releases.

+ Make this Software more portable, not less -- avoid using special
  vendor calls, header files that don't exist on most systems, or
  funny types.  When that is the only option please leave some
  compatible interface on the other side of a #if for the rest of us.
