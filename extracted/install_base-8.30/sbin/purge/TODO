Purge should not report unlink failure of "No such file" as it is usually a
race with another copy of purge, or install/installus.

It has been suggested that purge might get a slightly different criteria to
under other's site policy.  Viz. an option to force all but one copy of each
preserved file to be removed (with little or no reguard to age).

	$ purge -h
	...
	1	keep only one backup with the same name as each original

I'm not so sure this is a great idea.  There is a good chance that the one
you want to get back is the *older* of the backups -- not the previous
botched version.  Save me from `purge -i'?  I think it is better than I
thought before, but I still don't know which one to keep.  Thoughts:
	+ the largest?
	+ the oldest (let a purge w/o -1 clean that one up)?
	+ the newest one with a different owner, group mode?
	+ the newest one with a different magic number?
	+ the oldest one with the same magic number?


If we did `purge -i' we could fork the `instck -i' we tell the user to run.
Doing this would make us look much more intelligent (than we really are).
All this is beyond the scope of the original shell script we are emulating,
but would be used once in a while.
