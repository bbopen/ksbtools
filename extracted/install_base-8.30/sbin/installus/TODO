Use the explode version of fdrights.{c,h}


Bugs:

When a .owners file exists in /home/ksb/testing/.owners, and it lists
"thing/	ksb.* -d -m ...."  and /home/ksb/testing/thing/ exists with
the wrong owner, and the cwd of my installus is "thing".  Then a request
to update "." fails.


Features:

I think installus needs to be able to install a symbolic link.  The best
thing I can come up with is:
	file/glob/control	owner.group	@linkname

Which doesn't make me Happy because a glob match needs to be able to
pick off parts of the match to substitute in the "linkname".  For example
a simple one:
	rc3.s/S[0-9][0-9]local.*	*.staff	@../local.*
and I don't want to put an RE in the @ field because install/installus
uses globs and where is enough confusion on that topic.

So for now: use "op" to do this.


It we figure that out we might go for block/characters as well, via
instck's code for same.  Or just use "op".


installus -i, run mkowner.ksh and install [vinst even better] the output
	as .owners, or put mkowner.ksh in vinst (of all places)!


Document Installus.pl and add a hook to allow it to ask for the Customer's
	password once, then feed it to all the sub-installus processes.
