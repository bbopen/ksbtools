You will need the mkcmd tool, and msrc to build this.

Prereq: the msrc package (for msrc, xapply, dicer.c that we import).

0/ Pick a test host
	TEST_HOST=nostromo

1/ Change the default template path, BIN, and -Dtunes in Makefile.host
	vi Makefile.host
   if you have (sturct resource) and machine.h is wrong.
	CDEFS=-DRESOURCE
   If BIN is wrong
	BIN=/opt/ksb/bin

2/ make the mk binary, and install it (plug in your msrc options):
	msrc ... make source all install
   or
	mmsrc make all install   # I'm not going to show version mmsrc below

3/ install the templates (see ../../lib/mk for details)
	(cd ../../lib/mk && msrc ... make source install clean)

4/ test it if you like
	msrc ... make test 

5/ clean up the source directory
	msrc ... make clean
