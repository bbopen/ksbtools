The files in this directory are all mk applications -- that is mk
is used to do various things.

Menu	Provide a novice user with some suggestions as to what to do
	to a file.  (takes mk options)

Recipe	Like a Makefile, but always builds everything.  Useful under valid.

Info	Kinda like the 'file' command, in fact is calls the file command if
	mk cannot recognize the file type.
