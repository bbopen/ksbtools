Some make's build a depend "special.c: special.i" and I don't know
why.  Then make complains about not having a rule to build special.i
(which exists in the current directory).  ``make -t specail.i'' is
a hack to fix that.  I don't know how to shut make up.


Question: does install check the link count on the source file before it
unlinks it?  If the link count is >1 maybe we should NOT remove it?



Other things to think about:

Then support flags in instck's last column
	/kernel	-rwxr--r--	root:*	schg,nostrip

Add to the letter "n", "l", "s" aliases "nostrip", "ranlib", "strip" as
pseudo-flags.

Also make instck -G generate them: that would be another option, I
suspect (the list of flags to record).
