[You are going to need the msrc tools to build this. -- ksb]


Once in a while you want a mortal login to be able to take superuser actions.
Say mount a cdrom, or start/stop their own application that runs as under
a pseudo-user account.  But you really don't want to give away a superuser
shell, or even a shell as the application account.  That's where you need
a program like this one.

This program is different from:
	original op  (from Tom Christiansen)
	David Koblas's version of op
	super
	sudo
	pfexec (from Sun)
	and su or newgrp
But I think it is more secure and more useful than those.  See op.man,
op.html and refs.html for details about why I continue to support op.

The biggest win is that an auditor can (believe they) understand the
configuration file.  The simple structure and close proximity of all the
factors that make up a rule helps a lot.  I'd rather explain this rule to
an auditor than any sudoers rule:

	mount	/sbin/mount -t cd9660 -o ro,nosuid,extatt /dev/cd0 /$1 ;
		$1=^cdrom$
		groups=^packers$,^wheel$
		uid=root gid=operator

My Customers like op better for the online usage help:
	$ op -l
	op mount cdrom
	op unmount cdrom
	$ op mount cdrom

Op was originally developed at Convex by Tom Christiansen, and subsequently
published in a USENEX LISA proceedings.  This version was developed entirely
from the description that was published.  It has been extensively reworked
by ksb to add many features and sanity checks (op -S).

If you use the Koblas version of op you need only check for backslash quotes
on $ in rules, and the use of his version of inline scripts.  Switching to
my quoting rules ($$ -> $ from \$ -> $) is pretty easy, and my version of the
in-line script is also easy.  One other thing is that the first DEFAULT rule
in access.cf applies to any other file of rule, unless they include a DEFAULT
rule.

Report bugs to op at-no-spam-a-lot ksb dot npcguild dot org, please.
