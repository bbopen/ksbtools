Sometime you need a tool just to make things Easy!

I've found that people tend to edit files in-place rather than use install
to update them.  This is poor from because it is not so hard to
	cp /etc/motd /tmp/motd
	vi /tmp/motd
	install /tmp/motd /etc/motd

but it is just enough more typing and thought that most people are not going
to do it unless they think they'll make a mistake.

Of course most traffic accidents happen within 4 blocks of your house, most
file destruction happens when you least expect it.  And we all know it is
likely you should do the copy-edit-install more often.

So I coded a short C program that you can call as
	vinst /etc/motd

to do the 3 steps above.  It manages the temporary file for you and calls
install and cleans up.  You don't have to type all those (three) commands
anymore.

Bonus features:
	use -U to call installus rather than install
	uses your $VISUAL, $EDITOR or vi
	uses your $TMPDIR or /tmp
	uses the targets OLD directory for temp space if you can to that
	makes the target directory if is knows how (under -U)
	builds OLD for you before the install, if it can

Bugs:
	not op(8) safe at all since it calls _your_ editor - use installus

Usage Ideas:
	A wrapper shell script (yeah, really) that lets Clerical Staff
	edit kinda important files is easy.	
		#!/bin/ksh
		# set PATH/EDITOR for them (axe or mx or whatever)
		# sanity check for $DISPLAY, etc.
		# look a a command line keyword for the file to edit
		# run vinst -U $the_file

Follow-up:
	Make the template default work better.  The silly shell template
	was the first thing I though to put in (vinst.mc line 80).  Maybe
	look for $VINST_TEMPLATE or a command line option (and read $VINST).
	Looking at the name of the file (file.c) to search /usr/share/skel
	might be a thing to think about.
