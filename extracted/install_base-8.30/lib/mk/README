These templates take the place of any hard coded rules.  Your users may
pick and choose these, or rules of their own.  Some site specific
configuration *may* be done.

	1/  references to default compilers in dot-{c,f,p,l,y} may be changed
	   to reflect local compiler/processor names:
		s/cc-cc/cc-gcc/  
		s/-f77/-fortran/
		s/-kcl/-lisp/
		s/-pc/-pascal/
		s/-lex/-flex/
		s/-yacc/-bison/		or	s/-yacc/-byacc/

	   (but do not change the `hook' variable, unless you *have* to).

	2/  references to options (-v, -quiet) might be added if local users
	   like more/less info by default (on xloadimage for example).

	3/  submarkers might be added to some rule in place of (*).

	4/  more templates for local file extenders might be created.  If you
	   need help mail me, I might even put them in the next patch!

	5/  you'll have to replace calls to `ltroff' because it is a local
	   PUCC program (never to be released).

	6/  you might have to install (any of) xloadimage, patch, perl, etc.
	   to get their rules to work.
