You might want to use instck(1L) to generate more lines for this
file, for example all the setuid/setgid files on your system:

	find / \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f -print |
		xargs instck -GSLv

You might find it offensive that install doesn't want you to install
header files (*.h) and such with +x set.  If so take out those lines.
I like it because it stops broken Makefiles before they make a mess.
