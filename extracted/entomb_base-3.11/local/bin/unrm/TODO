Lint.  Maybe make -V do some more sanity checks.

Add a "stats" command to provide large users a feel for what
purge would do, like:
	unrm> stats
	login "ksb" has 78 files in crypts for a total of 980k
?=>	this accounts for 4% of /home/sac1
	the largest entombed file is "rabbit.gif" (400k)
	the oldest entombed file is "cursed.txt" (26 days old)
	unrm>

Not sure about the (?) line because we'd have to get preend's
code to evaluate the % full.  Let's say not on that.
