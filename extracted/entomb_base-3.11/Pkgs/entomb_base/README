What is this?

 This is the Purdue/ksb entombing system.  Files removed by programs
 linked with "libtomb" are cached for a while (long enough to get on a
 backup tape would be best case) in case their untimely loss is noticed.

 The 3 programs are "unrm" (the user agent to get files back), "entomb"
 the system agent to cache a file, and "preend" (the system agent to
 clean the older files from the tombs.

 Included as nifty side products are "rmfile" which helps novice users
 delete files with funny names (like "-") and "untmp" which should be
 used to clean /tmp from a ".logout" type file from casual users.


Source Contents:

 The subdirectories in this directory contain the essential parts of a
 file entombing system.

 README		This file.

 Pkg.sh		This shell script to build this package.

 lib/entomb	The source for a program that will entomb a file.

 lib/libtomb	The source for a library which provides entombing system API.
	These system calls cause a fork/exec of the 'entomb' program, above.

 etc/preend	A daemon which makes sure the tombs don't get too full of
	corpses.

 bin/unrm	A program that may be used to retrieve a file from a tomb.

 bin/rmfile	A "micro shell" to help novice users delete or entomb files
	with nasty names (like "~", "-", and " ").

 bin/untmp	A quick spell to remove all my junk from /tmp (just plain
	files, not subdirs).  This cleans up well for run away mktemp's.


 Paper		A document describing how to install the entombing system,
	and an (outdated) technical paper describing the system in detail.

Compile Hints:
	std msrc stuff, if you know how to do that.

	You need mkcmd version 7.24 or better.

	On Sun's Solaris you'll need my fake scandir(3) [from explode's
	repository, or from BSD Net2 tape + hacks]

	The AIX RS6000 port is hard to understand, but it works as well.

Thanks to:
	David Coleman for AIX clues.

	Matthew Bradburn for early work on the previous (RPC based) version,
	now long gone.
