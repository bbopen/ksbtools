This program reports a line in the format PEG uses for interface lists:
	host : interface : IP : MAC : switch|host : interface : vlan
the complete list for every interface on every host in the data center
is way more useful than you'd think.

An obvious list of:
	+ all the hosts
	+ all the network (TCP, SAN, NAS, and the like) cables one might lable
	+ all the IP's that should reverse in DNS (and maybe forward)
	+ MAC addresses to trace bad IP bindings, or lost switch ports
	+ all the switches you depend on, and they depend on...
	+ all the port lables one should have in the "description" attributes
	+ list of ports should all the cables need to come off a switch
	  (to replace it, or move a host, or split a vlan)
	+ find ports where the vlan doesn't match the IP

Less obvious:
	+ iLO/ALOM host database for lights-out management links
	+ ad hoc Sun system controller link database
	+ list of available ports (on hosts and switches)
	+ a count of all of these above for management reports

Even less obvious:
	+ a list of which hosts to backup in which order: we should backup
	  hosts from different switches in parallel to avoid maxing any uplinks
	+ a good way to find an NTP peer, the switch we are on, and a host
	  on the same switch, mixed with a peer on another switch would be
	  a nice start
	+ a fine way to pick a DNS cache (one on our switch, for example)
	+ uplink and VLAN balance analysis: is any switch too heavy on a
	  VLAN or can we tune the uplinks for the VLANs we carry?
