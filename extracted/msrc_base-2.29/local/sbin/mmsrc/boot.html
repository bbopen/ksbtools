<H1>The outline</H1>

To boot ksb's master source tools you need to dig a pretty
big trench.  Once you've done it <em>for one server</em> the others
are really easy. "Trust me," I said with a straight face.

<P>
First we need to build <code class="sh">mmsrc</code> which is a
C program that includes most of the features of <code class="sh">msrc</code>
and some of <code class="sh">hxmd</code> in a single stand-alone program.
We are going to use this too install 11 programs from their
master source directories, then we can install the other 60
with <code class="sh">msrc</code> (or you can keep using <code class="sh">mmsrc</code>).

<P>
Other hosts will use the <code class="sh">msrc</code> binary on this host
to get a "platform copy" of the tools which won't require this
long boot-strap process.

<H2>Which programs do I need?</H2>

These programs get to up to installing <code class="sh">msrc</code>, with
all the support you need to build the rest of the tool chain I use:
<OL>
<LI><code class="sh">mmsrc</code> from sbin/mmsrc
<LI><code class="sh">mkcmd</code>'s bin from bin/mkcmd
<LI><code class="sh">mkcmd</code>'s lib from lib/mkcmd
<LI><code class="sh">explode</code>'s lib from lib/explode
<LI><code class="sh">explode</code> 's binfrom bin/explode
<LI><code class="sh">install</code> from bin/install.d  ?
<LI><code class="sh">ptbw</code> from bin/ptbw
<LI><code class="sh">xclate</code> from bin/xclate
<LI><code class="sh">xapply</code> from bin/xapply
<LI><code class="sh">hxmd</code> from sbin/hxmd
<LI><code class="sh">hxmd</code>'s lib from lib/hxmd
<LI><code class="sh">msrc</code> from sbin/msrc
</OL>

<H2>How to I do it?</H2>

Download the most recent boot source packages for ksb's tools.
Unpack them under a directory that is <strong>not</strong>
rooted at /usr/src.  For example /home/lv426/bob, or /usr/msrc.

<P>
You should find a copy of this file in the unpacked directory.
You can read that one for a more up-to-the-minute version of,
but this one should give you a good idea of what
you'll see there.

<P>
There is a makefile and a shell script that runs in 3 steps.
See that Makefile for more information.  <!-- ZZZ -->
