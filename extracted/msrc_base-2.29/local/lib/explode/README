This is the explode MICE modules repository.

The other Pundits and I invite you to build reusable C components in either
C or C++ to put in this archive.  Send them to "ksb+pundit@sa.fedex.com".
Explodes parts don't require other parts to build (other than libraries),
contrast that to mkcmd's parts that actively require other parts and configure
them to make the program build.


Other ksb tools put files in the explode repository, for example "stater".
So don't delete the installed directory thinking this source will rebuild
the whole of it.
