In the dicer we implemented a transformational map hook (like Backus' FP)
	%[1/2]  is the common "split on `/', take 2"
	%[1/@.2]  maps all the strings after the split on `/' with .2
in effect building a loop  %[1/1.2]/%[1/2.2]/...%[1/$.2] so
	1.2.3.4/a.b.c.d/one.two.three.four
becomes
	2/b/two

We should implement this with a table of 256 fucntion pointers.
Each would prototype to take the same args as the Dicer, plus an
interger that would specify the "split token" -1 for white space,
'x' for the letter x.

Given that the array['@'] is not (void *)0 the template "%[1/@racoon]"
applied to the data "/usr/local/bin/oue" passes the escape code:
	(*pfcEscape)(pcDest, & iMax, "racoon]", "/usr/local/bin/oue", '/')
and expects the function to consume it's template, returning the rest
or (char *)0 for failure.  The pcDest is the new pcData for the Dicer,
if there is more to dice (so we'll have to strdup it).
