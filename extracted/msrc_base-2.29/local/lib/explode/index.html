Explode comes with some useful example code (useful in that
ksb's tools need these to compile).  As examples go they are
pretty mundane.

<P>
Here is a list of them for you to poke through:
<DL>
<DT><A HREF="avl.html">Adelson-Velskii Landis Height-Balanced Trees</A>
<DD>
Impress your friends with a cool sounding data structure!
These RAM-based trees provide a quick average time insert, delete, find
scheme and are very low overhead.
<DT><A HREF="ckpass.html">Password checking code</A>
<DD>
After a Customer gives you a password (UNIX style) how do you make
sure it is the correct one?  This case can tell you.
<DT><A HREF="identd.html">Identd C interface (TAP)</A>
<DD>
You call getpeername(2) to find the host and port, but this might
tell you the login name (or hash name) of the connected user!
Use only as directed.
<DT><A HREF="scandir.html">BSD Implementation of scandir for Non-BSD systems</A>
<DD>
Just what it says.  Compiles on Solaris for example.
<DT><A HREF="srtunq.html">Sorted, unique C strings</A>
<DD>
These are really cheap, I mean <STRONG>really</STRONG> cheap.
Just a way to keep track of a list of unique strings so we
don't repeat ourself.
<DT><A HREF="mk.html">Emulation code the mktmep, mkstemp, mkdtemp, and mkstemps(3)</A>
<DD>
I got sick of not having these under every OS.
<DT><A HREF="wise.html">wise module support</A>
<DD>
The Web Infrastructure Service Engine (wise) ideas are too long to explain
here: it is a way to make lots of little modules to lots of work for
a website.  Used by unity, rcls, rcds, stater, rico, and acld.
<DT><A HREF="cred.html">credential passing</A>
<DD>
An interface on top of sendmsg and recvmsg to make sending credentials
about as painless as possible.  Used my acld, and wise.
<DT><A HREF="dicer.html">the dicer</A>
<DD>
An interface to find the "good parts" of a well formatted string.
For examples see xapply and mk.
</DL>

<P>
Others will be added in new releases.
