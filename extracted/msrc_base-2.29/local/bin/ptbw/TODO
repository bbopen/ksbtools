Major fix needed: to make the pid send more reliable, use a
msgsnd/msgrcv to get the pid?  Of course multiple senders race.
Sigh.  SCM_CRED doesn't always pass the pid (on every UNIX system).
So we don't publish a pid that is always right.

We keep the comments from the token source, but can't output them
to the shell level (yet).

Maybe options:

Allow "variable resources allocation" (-jmax), to allow 1 to 10 max_jobs:
	ptbw -AR1 -j10 sh -c 'exec make -j $# all'
or allow -R to take a range (save an option letter)
	ptbw -AR1-10 sh -c 'exec make -j $# all'
the Pascal ".." might be better,  so it doens't look like subtraction?
	ptbw -R 2..30 sh -c ...
