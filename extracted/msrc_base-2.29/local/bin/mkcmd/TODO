Missing feature:
	The inverse of requires is "provides".  A module should be
	able to provide a name to supress the file inclusion of
	that name later.  For example in "my_control.m"
		provides "std_control.m"
	to supress any subsequent require of std_control.m ; or just
		provides "std_control"
	to supress any subsequent require of std_contorl.*.
	Note that this is not retro-active (we are not that magic).

Bugs:	Ends track is sometimes wrong, and I don't know why.

	If two options want the same ending (same "every") they can't
	get it now.  In "installus" "-W" and "-d" want the same every.
	Now they _exclude_ each other, which is sad.  We need a way to
	say "either -W or -d make this ending".  I've not figured that
	out yet (in a clean way).  "... 'w' { ends 'd' }" is close.
	In the code it would trigger "if (u_gave_d || u_gave_W)..."

Fixes:	An invisible option trigger "%" needs to be forced to own the top
	level parameter processing so we can make it exclude the other options
	that have special actions.  Or some such.  This code along with
	the bug above.


Final type work:
      + C++ style (kinda) template types would be _way_ cool.
	Allow a synthetic type to require a <type> in the decls?
	Might be more than a little over-kill.  Use the list attribute?
	How would we expand?  What would we declare/define?

	For example a "unique list of ..." might be nifty, allow the
	User to specify "-n 1 -n 2 -n 1" to get "1, 2" in as a vector
	of integers.  Mkcmd doesn't have a (good) way to make this
	generic.  If a type could take a compile-time parameter list
	(like C++ class's take <T>) we could instance stuff via the
	type name.  It is just too much work to go back and make the
	type name an expander string every place in mkcmd.

Move the more type conversion code into a template files:
	Like cvt.{mi,mc,mh} would have the code in them and we'd extract
	it from the files.  The hard coded stuff is clunky and I'd like
	to be able to replace check code as well, like using strtoul(3).

Our command line:
     +	Add an expander buffer size option -b (default 10k now), I've never
	needed a larger one.  And ANSI C limit limits of 509 characters mean
	I don't worry too much about it.

Manual pages generation:
     +	Polish manual page code for routines for file readers.
	Put in the help message from the pORMaster option
        Put in everything from the RG node
        For each hunk:
                put in the whole line with a hunk baner
                put in TP for each field
	In the "See Also" section put in a .\" to remind the editor
	to put in apropos section 5 file description pages.

      + Make the manual page system output HTML optionally in .html file.

File readers:
     +  Routines should complain if the conversion throws away the end of
	the line...  It complains now if you toss only the whole line.
	(Also check for function/action column as the last one?)

     +	Routines should be first class attributes, have names so that two
	options could use the same parser.  Requires a top level way to
	build a routine and a way to link it to a trigger
		routine global "name" {...	<in top level>
		}
		file ... {
			routine named "name"
		}
	would we expand it once for each client trigger?  I think so.

     -	This becomes problematic when the routines code for different
	converted types.  We do have to expand for each converted type
	or bound object and that is a pain (and there is no good way in
	mkcmd to make sure the names of the expanded routines are unique).

     +	When we read a "boolean" "toggle" or "action" from a file we
	should do something more clever than we do (like look at
	the data spec rather than ignoring it).
	At least suggest a "Boolean" enum in the docs.

     +  Booleans look for "0", "f"[nocase], "no", "false"[nocase], or
	all spaces, for "0" and anything else is "1".  Toggle I'm not
	sure?  Xor with what the boolean sez?  Hehehe.  Action we should
	do as we do, I believe (set the keep and call down).
