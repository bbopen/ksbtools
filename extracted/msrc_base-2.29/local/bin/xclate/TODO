Not much, just a detail to two.  Maybe support the "M?" command to
pass the process-id of the utility back on the wrapper port.  We
do that in ptbw and wrapw.

Under -m we could take (at about function Notify)
	-a  exit success only when the master and all clients exit 0
	-o  exit failure unless any client exits 0 (ignore master)
xapply could't pass these, but one could use an explicit wrapper,
or $XCLATE_1.


When stdout (the managed stream) is /dev/null we could allow multiple
output-only (non-IED) clients, after all mixing streams to the null
device is not going to confuse anyone :-).  That actually happens more
than you'd think.


I'm not sure about the -i option with a process.  The process gets
the original stdin for it's stdin, but -I still retains the same
fd (which means we can steal data).  I guess the Implementor knows
what she's asking for with -I and -i.  I don't think we need a way
to get util's stdin, because it could be an xclate -m if you wanted
that (for some strange reason).  If you don't want the original stdin
you can use "</dev/null" in the input command.

Maybe under -i we should not give the original stdin to the widows as
stdin either?  I don't know about that.  If you just want a fd that
we won't read pass it with "5<foo" or so.
