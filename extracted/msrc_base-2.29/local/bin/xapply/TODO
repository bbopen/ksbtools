Next steps:

Currently we only ask ptbw for tokens once.  We should come back to ask
for more when we didn't get the max and we are out of tokens to run tasks
(with more waiting).  I just don't have the energy to do it (yet).
Also I think we could free more resources earlier, maybe.


Nits:

We allocate _way_ too much memory, sanity check -P's parameter?
	$ xapply -P100000 -f ...
At compile time the first one that succeeds is the LIMIT (-D it)
	bash -c "ulimit -u"
	sysctl kern.maxprocperuid
	sysctl kern.maxproc
	CHILD_MAX | MAXUPRC from <sys/limits.h> or <sys/param.h>
	echo 65536
make -V report it, I guess.


Expander ideas:

+ %Q... might quote the word such that no special characters are evaluated
  by /bin/sh or /bin/ksh, without shell quotes around the word. That is
  quote $, ", `, ', #, ~, &, *, ?, [, (, ), {, ;, |, >, <, \, and white-space.
  Rules for # are hard, ${foo##*} shouldn't have a \ on the #'s.

Code bugs: we just plain die when someone tried to build a command bigger
than NCARGS (we don't check the expander buffer at all), we should fix that.
