<TITLE>The mark-up used in my HTML documents</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY>

These are the mark-ups I use to help make the documentation
for all my tools easier to read.

<H2>Code mark-up</H2>
<DL>
<DT>code.file {background-color: #cccc00}
<DD>
A section of code that comes from a file renders as a block element
as:
<blockquote><pre><code class="file">
# This is an example comment in a file mark-up
And this would be a line of code in the example file.
</code></pre></blockquote>
<DT>code.attr {color: #EE00EE }
<DD>
I have several features a call "attributes".  These are all
marked-up with this class.  Usually an attribute is a macro of
some kind (<code class="sh">m4</code>, or some processor I wrote)
and is marked-up in-line.  For example an attribute named "HUE"
would look like <code class="attr">HUE</code>.
<DT>code.sh {color: #00DD00 }
<DD>
A shell command might be taken for an English word, if it were
not identified with mark-up.  For example the shell command "halt"
is written as <code class="sh">halt</code>.
<DT>code.opt {color: #0000DD }
<DD>
A command line option to a shell command is given as <code class="opt">-o</code>.
<DT>code.param {font-style: italic}
<DD>
A parameter to a shell program is given as <code class="param">param</code>.
This is the same markup used to an option specification, for example
<code class="sh">make</code>'s recipe file under <code class="opt">-f</code>
is given as <code class="param">makefile</code>.
<DT>code.make {color: #DD0000 }
<DD>
I use a lot of <code class="sh">make</code> recipe files, so I've
had to give the macros in a <code class="param">makefile</code> special
markup.  The common "CFLAGS" macro is given as <code class="make">CFLAGS</code>.
<DT>code.env {color: #00CCCC }
<DD>
To show the difference between <code class="sh">make</code>'s macros
and shell environment variables we mark the latter with a different
markup.
The "PATH" environment variable is marked as <code class="env">PATH</code>.
<DT>code.libc {font-style: italic ; color: #CCCC00 }
<DD>
Some library functions and system calls might be mistaken for English
works without markup.  For example the "shutdown" system call is
marked as <code class="lib">shutdown</code>.
<DT>code.path { text-decoration: underline }
<DD>
A path through the filesystem may be marked as
<code class="path">/dev/null</code>.  This is not always
included, when it is clear that every element in a list must be
a filename.
<DT>code.rdist {color: #CCCC00 }
<DD>
Like <code class="sh">make</code>'s <code class="param">makefile</code>,
<code class="sh">rdist</code>'s <code class="param">distfile</code>
contains macros that might be mistaken for shell variables.
I mark these with <code class="rdist">INTO</code>.
<DT>code.markup {font-style: italic ; color: #00CC66 }
<DD>
To explain any other markup I would use the general purpose class "markup".
For example to explain the use of the commercial at sign in a
<code class="sh">scp</code> target.
<blockquote>
The commercial at (<code class="markup">@</code>) is placed
between the <code class="param">user</code> and <code>host</code>
parameters as <code class="param">user</code><code class="markup">@</code><code class="param">host</code>.
</blockquote>
</DL>

<H2>Emphasis</H2>
I limit the use of emphasis to really dangerous errors, for example
commands that would destroy data (which one would never execute), and
to new text in an old document while my proof readers are still
reviewing the draft.
<DL>
<DT>em.error { color: red }
<DD>
Text that is a never-type example.  For example:
<blockquote>
This would run <em class="error">sudo rm -rf /usr</em>, which is
not what we want to happen.
</blockquote>
<DT>em.new { color: #00cc33 }
<DD>
Updates that I want a proof reader to comment on.
<em class="new">This is the new example.</em>
</DL>
