This directory allows style sheets and the like (maybe a few
common graphics) to be cached in a common place for the HTML
documents included in the source directories.

Map the directory above this one (/usr/msrc/ or so) to "/msrc"
on you webserver.  If you also install the "manpage.cgi" so a
reference the "http://this-server/cgi-bin/manpage.cgi?..."
hits it we can include manual page links from the HTML docs.
This makes it way easier to read this heirarchy.
